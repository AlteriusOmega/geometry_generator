# geometry_generator

This is a python-based generator of intricate geometric patterns including grids, mandalas and fractals. It creates SVG vector graphics files which can be used for graphics, animations, laser engraving, CAD and more. I do laser engraving and was dissatisfied with the lack of available geometric pattern files out there in vector graphics format so hopefully this program will help alleviate this issue.

Here is an example of a pentagonal fractal created using geometry_generator.
